Inheritance in C++ an Overview

    Reusability is a very important feature of OOPs
    In C++ we can reuse a class and add additional features to it
    Reusing classes saves time and money
    Reusing already tested and debugged classes will save a lot of effort of developing and debugging the same thing again



What is Inheritance in C++?

    The concept of reusability in C++ is supported using inheritance
    We can reuse the properties of an existing class by inheriting it
    The existing class is called a base class
    The new class which is inherited from the base class is called a derived class
    Reusing classes saves time and money
    There are different types of inheritance in C++
