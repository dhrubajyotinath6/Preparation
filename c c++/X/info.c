/*Some important functions in math.h in C.
Type in ur ide for detailed syntax
abs ( )    This function returns the absolute value of an integer. The absolute value of a number is always positive. Only integer values are supported in C.
floor ( )    This function returns the nearest integer which is less than or equal to the argument passed to this function.
round ( )    This function returns the nearest integer value of the float/double/long double argument passed to this function. If decimal value is from “.1 to .5”, it returns integer value less than the argument. If decimal value is from “.6 to .9”, it returns the integer value greater than the argument.
ceil ( )    This function returns nearest integer value which is greater than or equal to the argument passed to this function.
sin ( )    This function is used to calculate sine value.
cos ( )    This function is used to calculate cosine.
cosh ( )    This function is used to calculate hyperbolic cosine.
exp ( )    This function is used to calculate the exponential “e” to the xth power.
tan ( )    This function is used to calculate tangent.
tanh ( )    This function is used to calculate hyperbolic tangent.
sinh ( )    This function is used to calculate hyperbolic sine.
log ( )    This function is used to calculates natural logarithm.
log10 ( )    This function is used to calculates base 10 logarithm.
sqrt ( )    This function is used to find square root of the argument passed to this function.
pow ( )    This is used to find the power of the given number.
trunc.(.)    This function truncates the decimal value from floating point value and returns integer value.

functions in stdlib
malloc()    This function is used to allocate space in memory during the execution of the
program.
calloc()    This function is also like malloc () function. But calloc () initializes the allocated
memory to zero. But, malloc() doesn’t
realloc()    This function modifies the allocated memory size by malloc () and calloc ()
functions to new size
free()    This function frees the allocated memory by malloc (), calloc (), realloc () functions
and returns the memory to the system.
abs()    This function returns the absolute value of an integer . The absolute value of a
number is always positive. Only integer values are supported in C.
div()    This function performs division operation
abort()    It terminates the C program
exit()    This function terminates the program and does not return any value
system()    This function is used to execute commands outside the C program.
atoi()    Converts string to int
atol()    Converts string to long
atof()    Converts string to float
strtod()    Converts string to double
strtol()    Converts string to long
getenv()    This function gets the current value of the environment variable
setenv()    This function sets the value for environment variable
putenv()    This function modifies the value for environment variable
perror()    This function displays most recent error that happened during library function call.
rand()    This function returns the random integer numbers
delay()    This function Suspends the execution of the program for particular time
