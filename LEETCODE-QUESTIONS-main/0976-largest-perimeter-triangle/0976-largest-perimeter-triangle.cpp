/*
a, b, c 

a + b > c
b + c > a
c + a > b

but since we are sorting the element

a < b < c

so if a + b > c satifies then it will be a triange
bcoz of sorting other two conditions will always remain true;


Given an integer array nums, return the largest perimeter of a triangle with a non-zero area, 
formed from three of these lengths. If it is impossible to form any triangle of a non-zero area, return 0.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,1,2]
Output: 5
Explanation: You can form a triangle with three side lengths: 1, 2, and 2.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,2,1,10]
Output: 0
Explanation: 
You cannot use the side lengths 1, 1, and 2 to form a triangle.
You cannot use the side lengths 1, 1, and 10 to form a triangle.
You cannot use the side lengths 1, 2, and 10 to form a triangle.
As we cannot use any three side lengths to form a triangle of non-zero area, we return 0.
