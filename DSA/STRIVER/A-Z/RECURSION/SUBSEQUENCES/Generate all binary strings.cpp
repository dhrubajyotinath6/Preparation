/*
Given an integer N , generate all binary strings of size N which do not contain consecutive 1s.

A binary string is that string which contains only 0 and 1.

Example 1:

Input:
N = 3
Output:
000 , 001 , 010 , 100 , 101
Explanation:
None of the above strings contain consecutive 1s. "110" is not an answer 
as it has '1's occuring consecutively.
