Given an array of sorted numbers, separate all duplicates from it in-place. You should not use any extra space; move all duplicates at the end of the array and after moving return the length of the subarray that has no duplicate in it.

Example 1:

Input: [2, 3, 3, 3, 6, 9, 9]
Output: 4
Explanation: The first four elements after removing the duplicates will be [2, 3, 6, 9].
Example 2:

Input: [2, 2, 2, 11]
Output: 2
Explanation: The first two elements after removing the duplicates will be [2, 11].

Problem : Given an unsorted array of numbers and a target ‘key’, remove all instances of ‘key’ in-place and return the new length of the array.

Example 1:

Input: [3, 2, 3, 6, 3, 10, 9, 3], Key=3
Output: 4
Explanation: The first four elements after removing every 'Key' will be [2, 6, 10, 9].
Example 2:

Input: [2, 11, 2, 2, 1], Key=2
Output: 2
Explanation: The first two elements after removing every 'Key' will be [11, 1].
