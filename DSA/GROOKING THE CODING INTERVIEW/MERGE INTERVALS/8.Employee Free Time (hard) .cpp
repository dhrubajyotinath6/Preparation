For ‘K’ employees, we are given a list of intervals representing each employee’s working hours. Our goal is to determine if there is a free interval which is common to all employees. You can assume that each list of employee working hours is sorted on the start time.

Example 1:

Input: Employee Working Hours=[[[1,3], [5,6]], [[2,3], [6,8]]]
Output: [3,5]
Explanation: All the employees are free between [3,5].
Example 2:

Input: Employee Working Hours=[[[1,3], [9,12]], [[2,4]], [[6,8]]]
Output: [4,6], [8,9]
Explanation: All employees are free between [4,6] and [8,9].
Example 3:

Input: Employee Working Hours=[[[1,3]], [[2,4]], [[3,5], [7,9]]]
Output: [5,7]
Explanation: All employees are free between [5,7].
