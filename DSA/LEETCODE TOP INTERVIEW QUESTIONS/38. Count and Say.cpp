/*
At the beginning, I got confusions about what is the nth sequence. 
Well, my solution is accepted now, so I'm going to give some examples 
of nth sequence here. The following are sequence from n=1 to n=10:

 1.     1
 2.     11
 3.     21
 4.     1211
 5.     111221 
 6.     312211
 7.     13112221
 8.     1113213211
 9.     31131211131221
 10.   13211311123113112211
 
From the examples you can see, the (i+1)th sequence is the 
"count and say" of the ith sequence!
