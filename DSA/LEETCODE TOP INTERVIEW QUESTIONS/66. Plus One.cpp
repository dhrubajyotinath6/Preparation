You are given a large integer represented as an integer array digits, where each digits[i] is the ith digit of the integer. The digits are ordered from most significant to least significant in left-to-right order. The large integer does not contain any leading 0's.

Increment the large integer by one and return the resulting array of digits.

 

Example 1:

Input: digits = [1,2,3]
Output: [1,2,4]
Explanation: The array represents the integer 123.
Incrementing by one gives 123 + 1 = 124.
Thus, the result should be [1,2,4].
Example 2:

Input: digits = [4,3,2,1]
Output: [4,3,2,2]
Explanation: The array represents the integer 4321.
Incrementing by one gives 4321 + 1 = 4322.
Thus, the result should be [4,3,2,2].
Example 3:

Input: digits = [9]
Output: [1,0]
Explanation: The array represents the integer 9.
Incrementing by one gives 9 + 1 = 10.
Thus, the result should be [1,0].



class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> plusOne(vector<int>& digits) {
      int n = digits.size() - 1;
      
      for (int i = n; i >= 0; --i) { 
          
        // traverse digits from the last element (least significant)
        // since we begin with the last digit, increasing that digit by one
        // results in overflow.  Therefore, all elements PRIOR to digits[0]
        // need to be considered since there may be additional nines between
        // digits[0], ... , digits[n].
        if (digits[i] == 9) {  
          digits[i] = 0;
        } else {  // current digit is not 9 so we can safely increment by one
          digits[i] += 1;
          return digits;
        }
      }
      // if the program runs to this point, each 9 is now a 0.
      // to get a correct solution, we need to add one more element with 
      // a value of zero AND set digits[0] to 1 (in the most significant position)
      // to account for the carry digit.
      digits.push_back(0);
      digits[0] = 1;
      return digits;
    }
