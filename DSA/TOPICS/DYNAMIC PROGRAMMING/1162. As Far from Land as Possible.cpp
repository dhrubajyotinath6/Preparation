Given an n x n grid containing only values 0 and 1, where 0 represents water and 1 represents land, 
find a water cell such that its distance to the nearest land cell is maximized, and return the distance. 

If no land or water exists in the grid, return -1.

The distance used in this problem is the Manhattan distance: the distance 
between two cells (x0, y0) and (x1, y1) is |x0 - x1| + |y0 - y1|.

 

Example 1:


Input: grid = [
               [1,0,1],
               [0,0,0],
               [1,0,1]
              ]
Output: 2
Explanation: The cell (1, 1) is as far as possible from all the land with distance 2.



Example 2:


Input: grid = [ 
                [1,0,0],
                [0,0,0],
                [0,0,0]
              ]
Output: 4
Explanation: The cell (2, 2) is as far as possible from all the land with distance 4.
 

Constraints:

n == grid.length
n == grid[i].length
1 <= n <= 100
grid[i][j] is 0 or 1
