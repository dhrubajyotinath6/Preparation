Given an array of integers, find two non-overlapping contiguous sub-arrays such 
that the absolute difference between the sum of two sub-arrays is maximum. 

Example:

Input: [-2, -3, 4, -1, -2, 1, 5, -3]
Output: 12
Two subarrays are [-2, -3] and [4, -1, -2, 1, 5]

Input: [2, -1, -2, 1, -4, 2, 8]
Output: 16
Two subarrays are [-1, -2, 1, -4] and [2, 8] 
Expected time complexity is O(n).
