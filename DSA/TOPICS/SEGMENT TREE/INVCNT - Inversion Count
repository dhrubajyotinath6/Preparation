Let A[0...n - 1] be an array of n distinct positive integers. If i < j and A[i] > A[j] then the pair (i, j) is called an inversion of A. 
Given n and an array A your task is to find the number of inversions of A.

Input
The first line contains t, the number of testcases followed by a blank space. Each of the t tests start with a number n (n <= 200000). 
Then n + 1 lines follow. 
In the ith line a number A[i - 1] is given (A[i - 1] <= 10^7). 
The (n + 1)th line is a blank space.

Output
For every test output one line giving the number of inversions of A.
